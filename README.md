Alephsys Lab Covid-19 Simulator
========

The Alephsys Lab is part of the Department of Computer Engineering and Mathematics at the "Universitat Rovira i Virgili" 
of Tarragona. The core of our research activity is aimed at investigating the laws governing the structure and dynamics 
of complex networked systems.

The Covid-19 simulator is a model created by the Alephsyslab research group of the Rovira i Virgili University. 
Its purpose is to simulate the spread of the Covid-19 virus in Catalonia at the county level. 
The user can enter how many simulation timesteps (days), the confinement policies and the zero patient.

The model is available for use in [Alephsyslab Covid-19 Simulator](https://simulator.alephsyslab.com/) 
It is recommended to use Firefox or Chrome for its use.

The implementation of the model used can be found here [Covid-19 Model](https://github.com/jtmatamalas/MMCAcovid19.jl) 

The model documentation can be found here [Covid-19 Model Documentation](https://jtmatamalas.github.io/MMCAcovid19.jl/v0.1/)

How to use
=================

Initially, when the web is accessed, the model has a simulation configuration by default. 
The default configuration does not have any restrictions and patient zero is located in the Alta Ribagor√ßa region.

Use the menu on the left to add confinements. It defines a range of timesteps for the confinement and then its characteristics.

* Mobility reduction.
* Permeability of confined households.
* Social distancing.

All characteristics have a range [0-1]
